
# QuestComplete (Beta)

**QuestComplete** is a Vencord plugin that adds a **“Spoof”** button to the **Quests tab** in Discord, allowing you to complete quests without having to install or launch games/apps manually.

> ⚠️ This plugin is still **work in progress (WIP)**.
> 
> Spoofing code adapted from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/aamiaa/204cd9d42013ded9faf646fae7f89fbb) by [aamiaa](https://gist.github.com/aamiaa).

### Notes:
* If Quest asks to choose platform just choose `Desktop`
